# Python Daily Practice 

This repository contains my **daily Python learning practice**, organized month-wise and date-wise.

I am currently focusing on **building strong Python fundamentals for 1 month** before starting **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** systematically to prepare for high-paying developer roles.

## âœ… Workflow
âœ… Each day:
- Run the auto-generator script to create `Month/DD.py`.
- The script auto-fills the topic for the day.
- Practice and commit using the auto-commit workflow.
- Push daily to maintain consistency.

## ðŸŒ± Goal
- Build a **strong Python foundation** within 1 month.
- Transition to **DSA practice using Python** for job preparation.
- Maintain clear, date-wise learning logs for easy revision.
